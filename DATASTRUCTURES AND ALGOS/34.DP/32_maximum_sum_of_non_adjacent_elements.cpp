You are given an array/list of ‘N’ integers. You are supposed to return the maximum sum of the subsequence with the constraint that no two elements are adjacent in the given array/list.
Note:
A subsequence of an array/list is obtained by deleting some number of elements (can be zero) from the array/list, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.
Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer ‘N’ denoting the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains ‘N’ single space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array/list.
Output Format:
For each test case, print a single integer that denotes the maximum sum of the non-adjacent elements.

Print the output of each test case in a separate line.
Note:
You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 500
1 <= N <= 1000
0 <= ARR[i] <= 10^5

Where 'ARR[i]' denotes the 'i-th' element in the array/list.

Time Limit: 1 sec.
Sample Input 1:
2
3
1 2 4
4
2 1 4 9
Sample Output 1:
5
11
Explanation To Sample Output 1:
In test case 1, the sum of 'ARR[0]' & 'ARR[2]' is 5 which is greater than 'ARR[1]' which is 2 so the answer is 5.

In test case 2, the sum of 'ARR[0]' and 'ARR[2]' is 6, the sum of 'ARR[1]' and 'ARR[3]' is 10, and the sum of 'ARR[0]' and 'ARR[3]' is 11. So if we take the sum of 'ARR[0]' and 'ARR[3]', it will give the maximum sum of sequence in which no elements are adjacent in the given array/list.
Sample Input 2:
2
5
1 2 3 5 4
9
1 2 3 1 3 5 8 1 9
Sample Output 2:
8
24
Explanation To Sample Output 2:
In test case 1, out of all the possibilities, if we take the sum of 'ARR[0]', 'ARR[2]' and 'ARR[4]', i.e. 8, it will give the maximum sum of sequence in which no elements are adjacent in the given array/list.

In test case 2, out of all the possibilities, if we take the sum of 'ARR[0]', 'ARR[2]', 'ARR[4]', 'ARR[6]' and 'ARR[8]', i.e. 24 so, it will give the maximum sum of sequence in which no elements are adjacent in the given array/list.





int maximumNonAdjacentSum(vector<int> &nums){
    vector<int >v (nums.size(),0);
    v[0]=nums[0];
    v[1]=max(nums[0],nums[1]);
    for(int i=2;i<nums.size();i++){
        v[i]=max(nums[i]+v[i-2],v[i-1]);  
    }
    return v[nums.size()-1];
}

// we can optimize this further
// we always need 2 things only the  prev and past prev so instead of maintaining the array
// we can space optimize by constant space
